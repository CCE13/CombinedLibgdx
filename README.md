# RunAI

Welcome to RunAI - an immersive application that enhances your running sessions with interactive visual and audio cues. Currently, our application is only compatible with Android devices. An APK file for the latest build is available for download through this link: ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gztleJth5F89z_HBBdQeTwS1LbGE3qyp?usp=share_link)).

RunAI incorporates the best of various platforms and languages:

- **Unity Engine**: Primarily used for crafting a user-friendly interface and stunning 3D renders.
- **Java**: Powers our foreground service, enabling accurate tracking of your runs even when the application operates in the background.
- **libgdx**: Runs the AI system on the background

We are currently working on an issue:

- We are currently experiencing minor bugs in our JNL system that may cause audio cues not to function correctly when the app is running in the background. We recognize the importance of this feature and our team is working diligently to fix this problem. Please note that this issue only occurs when the application is running in the background or when the phone screen is turned off. When the application is in focus, the audio cues work as intended.

Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Happy running!
